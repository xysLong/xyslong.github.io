Some time ago, I was searching for a new flat.
I haven't lived in Vienna long enough to have a clear sense of which parts of the city are actually *close* to my workplace.
For example, the 22nd district definitely *looks* farther away than the 15th, but I (living near *DonaustadtbrÃ¼cke* in the 22nd) actually need less time to get to work than my colleagues living in the 15th.

So, I created a visualization to show how long it takes to reach my department building from any location in Vienna using public transport.
I used geospatial data from *Open Data Austria* and travel time estimates from the *Google Maps API*.
The reference point for all calculations was Monday, January 13, 2025, at 9:00 AM.

With fewer contour levels and therefore improved readability:

After spending hours finalizing the visuals, it hit me:
commute time isn't even that important to me.
I don't go to the office that often, so optimizing for travel time actually doesn't make much sense ðŸ˜„
